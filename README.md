# Exploratory Data Analysis of Health Insurance Costs

## Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a health insurance dataset to identify key factors influencing medical insurance charges. The analysis demonstrates data cleaning, statistical exploration, correlation analysis, and data visualisation using Python.

## Business Context
Health insurance providers need to understand the main drivers of medical costs in order to price insurance plans accurately, manage risk, and design targeted health interventions.

## Business Questions
- Which demographic factors are associated with higher insurance charges?
- How does smoking status impact medical costs?
- Is there a relationship between BMI and insurance charges?
- Are there regional differences in insurance costs?
